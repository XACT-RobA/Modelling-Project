Golf modelling project for Uni

My group was tasked with modelling a golf ball from the edge of a green into the hole.
The code has been written for both chipping the ball into the hole and bouncing the ball int the hole.
The code for rolling(putting) the ball into the hole wasn't written by me, and so is not here.
